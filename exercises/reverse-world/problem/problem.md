Write a program that accepts a quoted string as an argument and reverses the order of words in the string, then prints the result.

-----------------
## HINTS

You're encouraged to use the builtin function `explode`.  
You can read more about the `explode` function here: http://php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php

To test your program, you can run it with `php program.php` and a quoted string as an argument, e.x.

```sh
$ php program.php "Knife-wrench! For kids."
```

where `program.php` is replaced by the name of your file.

In this example, you would expect the output to be:

```$sh
kids. For Knife-wrench!
```
