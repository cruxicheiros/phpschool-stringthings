Write a program that accepts two words as arguments and concatenates them with a space between them, then prints them.

-----------------
## HINTS

You can access command-line arguments via the global `$argv` array.

The concatenation operator in PHP is `.`

To test your program, you can run it with `php program.php` and two words as arguments, e.x.

```sh
$ php program.php concat world
```

where `program.php` is replaced by the name of your file.

Be aware that concatenation does not automatically add a space between words.
